  <h1>videojs-speak-descriptions-track Demo</h1>

  <p>A Video.js 7 middleware that uses browser speech synthesis to speak descriptions contained in a description text track</p>

  <p>If the description (AD) text track is enabled, then browser speech synthesis (also known as "text to speech" or TTS) is used to announce each text cue when it is displayed (if the browser supports speech synthesis). If it takes longer to announce the cue than its display time, then pause the video playback until the speech synthesis finishes (known as 'extended description').</p>

  <p><strong>Important Disclaimer:</strong> this plugin is not intended to be used to specifically address any accessibility requirements (e.g. WCAG 2.0 Success Criteria 1.2.3, 1.2.5, and 1.2.7). It is an experimental implementation of TTS for text video description. Users of this plugin should not assume that any level of accessibility support is provided by the features of this plugin.</p>


  <!-- NOTE: we have to disable native Text Track support for the HTML5 tech,
    since even HTML5 video players with native Text Track support
    don't currently support 'description' text tracks in any
    useful way! Currently this means that iOS will not display
    ANY text tracks -->
